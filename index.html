									<figcaption>A Red-Tailed Hawk that I rescued and released from the highway. (While my hold was not the best, this was one of my first experiences holding a raptor and this was taken while I was examining the bird before release after consulting with a wildlife rehabber).</figcaption>
								</figure>
								<p>I have had the unique opportunity to experience bird conservation from a multitude of different perspectives. My first experiences with birds were primarily through domestic poultry. As a child, I would spend months studying for the annual poultry show at the local county fair, determined to become the top showman. Finally, after an ongoing rivalry with another 4H member, I achieved that. Shortly after, I was invited by the poultry judge to apprentice under him and learn the standard for judging poultry. I followed him across the state of Michigan, observing and training at different fairs until eventually, one day, I received a call to judge a fair on my own. Safe to say, it was through that experience that I became encaptived.</p>
								<p>Gradually, my interest broadened to other bird species. I became engrossed in banding at my local bird banding station, training birds of prey at the nature center, and birding across the state, chasing rare species and learning the songs and identification for North American species. During my time at Kalamazoo College, I became fortunate to work with an ornithologist and learn about stress in birds (he was quick to correct me on this of course as he considers himself to be a "physiologist who uses birds as a model"). As a biology requirement, students at Kalamazoo College had to complete a senior research thesis. I was lucky and amidst the chaos of COVID, I moved to Kentucky to work with this professor on a project examining stress response in tree swallow nestlings. Through this research, I suddenly became aware of the fact that this field of study could be a careeer.</p>
								<p>During my final year of undergraduate study, I continued with bird banding projects and even started a birding club, to introduce students to bird conservation and ornithology. We collaborated with local groups and assisted with a bird-window collision monitoring group to assess the impact of buildings on campus. Shortly after, I had the opportunity to present the work to Studio Gang, an architectural firm that designed one of the buildings we monitored. As senior year progressed, I was offered a directorship at the Kalamazoo Nature Center where I had been volunteering for the previous two years. At the same time, I also took on a field assistant position for a sound ecology study. At the same time, I began volunteering at a wildlife rehabilitation center. Needless to say, this was a particularly busy time as I completed my degree.</p>
								<p>Since my undergraduate, I continued to work for the Kalamazoo Nature Center, improving welfare and standards for birds of prey in captivity. I have since moved on to begin my graduate studies in the Burness Lab at Trent University in Canada. While I have moved, my passions have persisted and I continue to collaborate with many of the same groups that I had previously, as well as many new ones. In this living portfolio, you can find further details on my current work.</p>
								<p>To this day I continue judging at poultry shows, in hopes that some young showman may find the same passion as I once did.</p>

									<figcaption>Teaching my field assistants how to apply color bands, to distinguish between male and female Tree Swallows.</figcaption>
								</figure>
								<p>My research is focused on the impact of human activity on populations of wild birds. Humans have altered the environment drastically over the past 50 years and, as a result, wildlife populations have declined. While many studies focus on singular stressors, my interest is in the interactive effects of multiple stressors brought about by human activity. Below you can find a description of the specific research that my M.S.c encompasses.</p>
								<figure class="image main">
									<img src="images/IMG_3179.jpg" alt="" />
									<figcaption>A nestling Tree Swallow. We recorded body measurements on nestlings to compare growth and development.</figcaption>
								</figure>
								<p>Climate change and urbanization have drastically altered habitats to such a degree that natural biological cycles are altered. Artificial light at night (ALAN) is one product of urbanization that can affect both the behavior and physiology of wild animal populations. This disturbance can occur when light exposure affects the circadian rhythms of the body. Since circadian rhythms are generated by environmental cues (like light), the effects of ALAN are of concern when it comes to already stressed wildlife populations as they may struggle to adapt.</p>
								<figure class="image main">
									<img src="images/IMG_3330.jpg" alt="" />
									<figcaption>Measuring a nestling Tree Swallow with calipers.</figcaption>
								</figure>
								<p>Melatonin, a “hormone of darkness,” is found in both birds and mammals and is primarily produced during the night. In urban spaces where ALAN is prevalent, melatonin production may be affected. Previous studies have demonstrated this effect in the lab, however, few have taken a field approach. The consequence of melatonin suppression is therefore not well documented in wild populations of animals. However, lab studies suggest that melatonin can lower core body temperature, reduce activity, and enhance antioxidant pathways. For populations that are already facing the effects of heat stress, melatonin may play a critical role in regulating body temperature.</p>
								<figure class="image main">
									<img src="images/IMG_2808.jpg" alt="" />
									<figcaption>Lakefield Sewage Lagoons, a surprisingly beautiful field site. Field equipment set up at the site before our experiment.</figcaption>
								</figure>
								<p>To better understand the effects of ALAN on wild bird populations my research focuses on the thermal responses of tree swallows to nighttime ALAN exposure. I anticipate that ALAN will affect thermoregulation and the reproductive success of adult tree swallows and their offspring. To test this, I will install lights in bird boxes and measure activity level, core body temperature, and melatonin. For a breeding population of birds, ALAN may have consequences for fitness and reproduction; further understanding of these consequences can better inform conservation practices in the future. <a href="https://burnesslab.ca/">See here</a> for additional information about current work in the Burness Lab.</p>

								<!-- Introduction -->
   								 <h3>Introduction</h3>
    							<p>My work encompasses a broad range of topics, but my central focus is bird conservation. In both my professional and personal ventures, birds have been a common connector; my passion is to contribute to current research on conservation. As populations continue to decline, I hope that I may play a role in the many efforts to sustain these populations for the generations to come. I welcome any inquiries, collaborations, or feedback on this work, so please feel free to reach out. Below you can find my latest projects.</p>

									</figure>
   								 <p>Bird banding has been a passion of mine for the past 5 years, and I have had the privilege to contribute to several long-term banding data sets through this work. I began bird banding at the Pitsfield and Kalamazoo Nature Center banding stations, and it is always a pleasure to return to those stations during my visits back to the States. Since I began my graduate work in Canada, I have been banding with the Tommy Thompson, James Oliver, and Simcoe bird banding stations, learning new techniques and building my skill sets.</p>

   							 <!-- Wildlife Rehabilitation -->
   							 <h3>Wildlife Rehabilitation</h3>
   								 <p>My involvement in wildlife rehabilitation started as an extension of my training as Animal Programming Director at Kalamazoo Nature Center but persisted well after. I trained at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wildside_rehabilitation_center/?hl=en">Wildside Rehabilitation Center</a> where I learned how to triage a variety of wildlife. My primary focus however was raptors. During my time at Wildside, I assisted in the rehabilitation and release of hawks, falcons, eagles, and owls, including species at risk. Below you can find the accounts of a few successful cases.</p>
									<figure class="image main">

									<p>While I have since moved out of state, I remain connected with local rehabbers and am happy to assist in the transfer of any injured wildlife to rehabilitation centers, to ensure they receive proper care. </p>
									
   							 <!-- Raptor Programming -->
    							<h3>Raptor Programming</h3>
  								<p>Previously, I was the Animal Programming Director at <a href="https://naturecenter.org/">Kalamazoo Nature Center</a>. In this role, I designed and implemented new program material, training protocols, and aviary plans for Kalamazoo Nature Center's animal ambassadors.</p>
								<p>In this role, I also updated bird of prey training to better align with industry standards, assisted with fundraising $30,000 toward enclosure renovations, and improved enrichment/health protocols to exceed DNR regulations and to support animal welfare in captivity. During this time, I also updated educational programs to better reflect conservation messages centered on themes of urbanization and climate change. Our team presented these programs throughout the community and partnered with organizations to connect underserved communities with nature.</p>

								</figure>
								<p>At Kalamazoo Nature Center, I glove-trained birds of prey (red-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, broad-winged hawk, turkey vulture, screech owl, and rough-legged hawk) utilizing reinforcement strategies. As programming director, I trained/managed a team of 20 volunteers, educators, and staff on animal handling and medical care and introduced better welfare practices in accordance with the International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council's recommendations.</p>

								<p>Currently, I have resumed public workshops in collaboration with Shrew, a business specializing in habitat assessments and conservation education. To make science accessible, I am continuing with conservation education. While I hope that my research will have a positive impact, I realize that much of scientific discovery is not open to the public so, through a series of monthly workshops, I hope to better serve the community through accessible knowledge. You can find upcoming programs that I will be hosting through the website, <a href="https://www.shrewsolutions.com/">linked here</a>, or feel free to contact me directly for program requests.</p>

								<p>While I no longer am employed by Kalamazoo Nature Center, I remain in collaboration with my former team as a programming consultant, advising on bird of prey enrichment, training, and program content. I have also consulted with other nature centers interested in improving their standards for captive birds of prey. While I no longer train for public programming, I remain invested in the field and continue to train birds of prey under my own permit.</p>

								<p>I continue to judge a local county fairs as a poultry judge. While I am not currently APA certified, I enjoy youth and open shows and have experience judging meat, breed, and showmanship classes. My focus as a breeder has been primary Asiatic breeds, like the Brahma. I have 8 years of experience working in the field and intend to eventually pursue APA certification when I complete my degree.</p>

								<p>Window collisions remain as one of the top mortality factors for wild birds. Throughout my time in undergraduate studies, I focused on collaborating with window collision monitors, to evaluate local architecture. We were also able to assess the effectiveness of common window deterrents and create programming to educate homeowners on bird-safe design. Further information can be <a href="https://abcbirds.org/blog/truth-about-birds-and-glass-collisions/">found here</a> or through one of the bird-safe workshops.</p>
